Live site : https://ronaldlamdev.github.io/space-tourism/

Space site for Frontend Mentor created using React, React Router Dom V6, and Tailwind CSS.

***For some reason, when I open the site locally the crew images do not cause the crew page to scroll past the max height 
which is 100% of the viewport, but when I do open the site as a deployed project, the crew site is scrollable past max height.
Please let me know how to fix this.***

###Things I've learned from creating this project

-Improved React Router Dom skills
-Used Row reverse and column reverse for the first time
-How to fetch data from a JSON file and map out data 
-Created multiple conditioned ternary operators
-Added conditioning in styling for links when clicked

###Things I want to improve

-Simpler Tailwind code like shortening down utility classes into a single class for better readability
-Improve design skills and planning/problem solving skills
-Learn a UI component frameworks such as Chakra UI or Material UI
